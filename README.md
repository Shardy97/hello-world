##Good Morning kiddos!

###Again, **Shalom**!

The ideal (somewhat reaslistic) weekend schedule: Waking up on a saterday with absolutely no obligations is _extremely_ delightful. 
:relaxed:

**Today's To-Do List**

 [ ]Wake up at naturally.

Eat a _healthy_ breakfast 

Get lazy and toast frozen waffles

Eat the lazy waffles and waste my time on phone. But tell yourself you deserve time to relax for your working hard over the week. 

Watch the most recent [JK News videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfPhyExfcaqJBKc3HO3cNBw). They make you feel updated on pointless recent articles.

Get sucked into the black hole that is YouTube.  

**EAT LUNCH!** You. Love. Lunch... Today's menu:

1. salad
2. rice
3. omlet

Clean your room so you feel a little accomplished
